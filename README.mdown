Fibonacci and Memoization
===
Sample code mentioned in the [Recursion and Memoization](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2014/04/12/recursion-and-memoization/) blog post. This is a comparison of two recursive Fibonacci programs written in Ruby. One uses memoization, and the other does not.

By definition...

* [Fibonacci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) numbers are always positive integers.
* The n _th_ number in a fibonacci sequence is f(n). f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
* The first two numbers of the sequence are 0 and 1, or 1 and 1 depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence.
